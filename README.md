## Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and preparing a fleet equipment inventory dataset that was originally poorly formatted after conversion from its source system.

The goal was to make the data accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis.

## Dataset Issues Identified
- Department names were split across two columns
- Presence of empty rows
- Duplicate records
- Spelling errors in department names
- Inconsistent whitespace (double spaces)

The following steps were performed using Microsoft Excel techniques:

1. Adjusted column widths to ensure all values were clearly visible
2. Removed empty rows using filter functionality
3. Identified and removed duplicate records
4. Corrected spelling errors across text columns
5. Removed double spaces using Find and Replace
6. Combined split department columns using Flash Fill
7. Standardized department names using an official department list
8. Removed unnecessary columns after consolidation
